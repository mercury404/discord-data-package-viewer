# Discord Data Package Viewer
A small little script that I coded to show some useless info about your Discord Data Package (id, username, status, custom status, theme, version and locale, also checks if certain settings and stuff are true like if you are verified, if you are a mobile user and if you use discord developer mode), it's a pretty dumb project with no use but you can check it out if you want, however I would reccomend using discordpackage.com or something similar.
